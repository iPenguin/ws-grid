# wsGrid

This project is a basic table/grid that gets it's data from a WebSocket connection.

## Features

* optional header clicking to sort columns.
* optional zebra striping.
* optional cell/row click, double click events.
* does not require any third party libraries to use.
* it uses modern JavaScript technologies, so don't expect it to work in older browser.
* is designed to be easily themed.
* is designed to be used with WebSockets, but also to be used with other data sources.

This project takes some inspiration from jqGrid.

Because I'm using module import/export, you need to be using at least Chrome 60, or Firefox 54, and you must have experimental flags turned on.
