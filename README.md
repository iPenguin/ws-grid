This project is a basic table/grid that gets it's data from a WebSocket connection.

## Features

This grid...

* does NOT rely on any third party libraries.
* it uses modern JavaScript technologies[1].
* is designed to be easily themed.
*

[1] This project is also test bed for all sorts of new ECMAScript features.

Some of the ECMAScript features that are used in this project are:

* block scoping (let)
* arrow function declarations
* const
* classes
* default parameters
* parameter context matching
* promises
* modules (import & export)

Because these features are use you must be using at least Chrome 60, or Firefox 54, and you must have experimental flags turned on.
